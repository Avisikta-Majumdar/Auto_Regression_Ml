## Data :
Users have to give the data to check accuracy & the data should be clean and don't have a categorical column.

## Modelling :
The analysis and model creation can be found in the app.py file. 

The main packages used are pandas , flask and sklearn .  

## Deployement :
The web app has been build using basic HTML, CSS, Flask and Herkou.
